### Problem Statement

Many students have many different commitments while studying to do well on the SAT. Students have sports,classes,family, and studying for the SAT exam. These are a lot of commitments to juggle all at once. This project aims to explore the trends of both sections of the SAT, and to see what section students should focus on to help increase their score in the most proficient way possible.

The data sets give a list of states and the average scores for the EBRW and Math sections of the SAT in 2018 and 2019.These datasets will be used to look at trends between both sections of the SAT. Both 2018 and 2019 SAT datasets are used so that it can be shown that the trends detected are consistent through multiple years. 

### Analysis Summary

Analyzing the data has given insights into important trends shown in the point recieved by students in different states on the SAT exam. The first insight is the correlation between points recieved on the EBRW section and the math section. The scatterplots show that an increase in EBRW points attained by students correlates to an increase in math points in both 2018 and 2019. Scatterplots also show that an increase in math points attained by students correlate to an increase in EBRW points in both 2018 and 2019. 

The second insight is that the average points attained by students on the math section of the SAT was less than the average points attained on the EBRW section.

The third insight is that in the 2018 SAT dataset 43 out of the 51 states had the average points scored in the math section lower than the EBRW section. 2019 had 41 out of the 51 states having higher points attained in the EBRW section than the math section. 

### Conclusions/Recommendations

An article on Piqosity, which is a personalized learning website for standard testing, explains how the best way to improve scores is to focus on improving the sections you did weaker on. It is easier for students to increase lower scores that students did badly on than improving scores that students already did well on. When looking at the analysis of both SAT datasets and applying it to the suggestion by piqosity, it is recommended for schools and students to focus on the math section of the SAT. The focus on increasing the math section is because the average math points attained by students is less than points attained in the EBRW section. The data also shows that increased point on the math section can correlate to an increasein the EBRW section.
